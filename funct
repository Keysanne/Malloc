allowed functions:
	◦ mmap(2)
	◦ munmap(2)
	◦ getpagesize(2 or 3 depending on OS)
	◦ getrlimit(2)
	◦ The authorized functions within your libft (write(2) par exemple ;-)
	◦ The functions from libpthread

Submit also your folder libft including its own Makefile at the root of your repository. Your Makefile will have to compile the library, and then compile your project.

You are allowed a global variable to manage your allocations and one for the threadsafe.


(address + (8 - 1)) & ~(8 - 1) -> aligned_address
n = 1000   | N = 1032
m = 10.000 | M = 10.032
-> 32 bytes to align (determined by sizeof(max_align_t))
